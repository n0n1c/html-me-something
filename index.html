        <p class="intro">This is the status of our attempt to renovate our kitchen with very little previous construction experience.(We still have all our fingers!)</p>

        <p class="intro">We recently bought our first home</p>
          <article>
            <p class="intro">The house was structurally very sound, but every inch of the house needed a cosmetic upgrade.</p>
            <p class="intro">We began by painting the walls and ceilings in one of the bedrooms and the living room</p>
            <p class="intro">The first real down-to-the-studs renovation was the kitchen</p>
            <h2 class="titles">Kitchen Walls</h2>
            <img class="interior" src="images/kitchentilesremoved.jpg" alt="Kitchen wall tiles" height="400">
            <p class="caption">Half way up the kitchen walls were covered with two layers of tile, a two inch deep layer of mortar and a metal grate.</p>
            <p class="caption">Removal of these tiles involved using a hammer drill to take off the top layer of tiles.</p>
            <p class="caption">The next layer of tiles were removed using a hammer to chip both the tiles and mortar into smaller pieces</p>
            <p class="caption">The metal grate was then pulled off the walls with gloves on, because the edges were razor sharp.</p>
            <img class="interior" src="images/kitchenshiplapwall.jpg" alt="Shiplap on walls" height="700">
            <p class="caption">We then installed shiplap on the walls</p>
            <h2 class="titles">Kitchen electrical</h2>
            <img class="interior" src="images/kitchenoutletforrange.jpg" alt="Range hood outlet" height="700">
            <p class="caption">We also had to install new electric outlets and move one existing outlet.</p>
            <p class="caption">That's where we are so far</p>
