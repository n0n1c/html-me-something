        <p>This is the status of our attempt to renovate our kitchen with very little previous construction experience.(We still have all our fingers!)</p>

        <p>We recently bought our first home</p>
          <article>
            <p>The house was structurally very sound, but every inch of the house needed a cosmetic upgrade.</p>
            <p>We began by painting the walls and ceilings in one of the bedrooms and the living room</p>
            <p>The first real down to the studs renovation was the kitchen</p>
            <h2>Kitchen Walls</h2>
            <img src="images/kitchentilesremoved.jpg" alt="Kitchen wall tiles" height="400">
            <p>Half way up the kitchen walls were covered with two layers of tile, a two inch deep layer of mortar and a metal grate.</p>
            <p>Removal of these tiles involved using a hammer drill to take off the top layer of tiles.</p>
            <p>The next layer of tiles were removed using a hammer to chip both the tiles and mortar into smaller pieces</p>
            <p>The metal grate was then pulled off the walls with gloves on, because the edges were razor sharp.</p>
            <img src="images/kitchenshiplapwall.jpg" alt="Shiplap on walls" height="700">
            <p>We then installed shiplap on the walls</p>
            <img src="images/kitchenoutletforrange.jpg" alt="Range hood outlet" height="700">
            <p>We also had to install new electric outlets and move one existing outlet.</p>
            <p>tThat's where we are so far</p>
